<p>Today I&#8217;m happy that I can finally announce version 1.0.0 of <a href="http://elm-bootstrap.info/">Elm Bootstrap</a>.
When I set out to develop Elm Bootstrap, my goal was to make an <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> package that
makes it easy to build responsive and reliable web applications in Elm using Twitter Bootstrap. This version is the first step
towards that goal.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Elm Bootstrap is a fairly comprehensive library package that wraps the upcoming Twitter Bootstrap 4 CSS framework.
It provides a range of modules and functions to make it pleasant and reasonably typesafe to create a Bootstrap styled
web application in Elm without giving up too much on flexibility. Most of Twitter Bootstrap is opt-in and the same applies to Elm Bootstrap.
That means that you can pick and choose which parts you wish to use for your application.</p>

<td class="content">
You will find modules in Elm Bootstrap that corresponds to most of what Twitter Bootstrap refers to as components.
There are no such thing as components in Elm, there are only functions, and functions can be grouped into modules
When I speak about modules you know I&#8217;m talking about Elm and when you see components mentioned you know it&#8217;s about
Twitter Bootstrap.

<p>The most comprehensive (and only) application using Elm Bootstrap at the time of writing this is the

In time this will improve a lot. With the introduction of <a href="https://ellie-app.com/">Ellie</a> we now also
have a great way to share interactive/editable examples of how to use Elm Bootstrap.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need help, there is a #elm-bootstrap channel on the Elm slack where you can ask for help.
I&#8217;ll try to help when I can and hopefully others can help out there going forward too.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> is one of the most popular CSS (with some JS) frameworks for building responsive, mobile first web sites.
At the time of writing version 4 is in alpha-6 and apparantly the plan is to move into beta fairly soon.
Version 4 is fully embracing flexbox, which will provide much better control and flexibility.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a wrapper for Twitter Bootstrap probably doesn&#8217;t score very high on the hipster scale. However
it&#8217;s no denying it&#8217;s still very popular and probably will be for some time to come. More importantly I&#8217;m using
it in projects and have done so several times in the past, so I know it would be useful to me when I get
a chance to work on an Elm project. Hopefully others will find Elm Bootstrap useful too.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reasonably_type_safe_you_say">Reasonably type safe you say ?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s reasonable is obviously a matter of opinion. But since it&#8217;s an Elm package we&#8217;re talking about, the
context is that it&#8217;s for use in a statically typed language that promotes reliability as a core characteristic.
There is also no denying that Elm doesn&#8217;t have the most advanced type system out there. But in my humble opinion it&#8217;s
one of the most approachble ones I&#8217;ve come across in terms of statically typed functional languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s no stopping you from just including the CSS from Bootstrap and start using it with the standard Elm Html functions today.
Let&#8217;s face it, Twitter Bootstrap is mostly just a whole bunch of classes you apply to relevant elements you compose and voila.
But applying a bunch of class strings is quite error prone, and it&#8217;s easy to nest elements incorrectly or apply incorrect classes to
incorrect elements. Trying to alleviate that to some extent is what I&#8217;ve been trying to balance with necessary flexibility
when defining the API for Elm Bootstrap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m under no illusions that I&#8217;ve found the sweetspot that perfectly balances type safety, flexibility and usability.
But given the constraints (the type system in Elm and my relatively short experience with statically typed functional languages),
I&#8217;m reasonably happy with the API as a starting point. Real life use and feedback will surely help it develop
in a direction where more and more people can agree that it really is reasonably type safe !</p>

<h2 id="_the_development_story_aka_refactoring_galore">The development story - aka refactoring galore</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For quite some time my main endevaours in Elm has been developing editor support for Elm in Light Table
through my <a href="https://github.com/rundis/elm-light">elm-light</a> plugin. I&#8217;ve also been working <a href="http://rundis.github.io/blog/tags/haskellelmspa.html">blogging</a> a bit on
my journey learning Elm (and a little Haskell). But in November last year I decided I wanted to dive deeper into Elm, trying to make something
substantial. Ideally something useful, but first and foremost something that would gain me experience in designing an API for use by others in Elm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bootstrap wrapper idea has crossed my mind several times in the past, but never materialized. I did some
research, but couldn&#8217;t find anything out there for Elm that was quite as ambitious as I had in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_where_to_start">Where to start ?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I first started looking at the very impressive <a href="https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl">elm-mdl</a> which brings
awesome Google Material Design support to Elm. I got a ton of inspiration from this library.
Next up I had a look through <a href="https://github.com/evancz/elm-sortable-table">elm-sortable-table</a>, trying to pick
up on good advice and experience for tackling the interactive components in Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hmm okay, let&#8217;s just start and see where it leads me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_think_code_refactor_ad_infinitum">Think, code, refactor ad infinitum</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I started with a couple of modules using a record based api for everthing.
That gave me an API that was pretty type safe and certainly explicit. But it looked horribly verbose
where in many cases it didn&#8217;t provide enough value and even in some cases put way to many restrictions on what you could do.
DOH. Back to the drawing board.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know ! Let&#8217;s have 3 list arguments for everything; Options (exposed union types), attributes and children.
So I refactored almost everything (silly I know), but it didn&#8217;t really feel right with all those lists and I also started
to get concerned that users would find it confusing with the std Elm Html functions taking 2 lists.
Time to think and refactor again. After that I started to run into cases where I wanted to compose stuff from
several modules, well because stuff is related.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll spare you all the details, but I can&#8217;t remember ever having refactored so much code so frequently that I have been during
this process. Doing this in Elm has been an absolute pleasure. Truly fearless refactoring. The kind that is really hard
to explain to other peope who haven&#8217;t experienced it. The Elm compiler and I have become the best of buddies during evenings
and nights the past few months.</p>

<h3 id="_reaching_out_to_the_elm_community">Reaching out to the Elm Community</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the middle/end of January I reached a point where I on one hand was ready to just ship something.
At the same time I was really unsure about what I had created so I reached out for comments on the elm-slack.
Turns out that both Mike Onslow and Richard Feldman both have had overlapping ideas about creating a Bootstrap package for Elm.
We quickly decided to see if we could cooperate in some fashion and decided to hook up on Google Hangout.
Awesome ! We&#8217;ve had many really interesting discussions on slack especially related to API design. It&#8217;s been really great
to have someone to talk to about these things (other than my analysis paralysis brain).</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_going_forward">Going forward</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I could have been iterating forever trying to nail the best possible API and/or try to support every bit of Twitter Bootstrap,
but I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s better to just get it out there and get feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The API will certainly get breaking changes going forward, but I don&#8217;t see that as such a big negative given
the semantic versioning guarantees and version diffing support provided by the Elm package manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m hoping folks find this interesting and useful enough to give it a try and give feedback on their
experiences. In the mean time I&#8217;m going to work on improving the documentation, test support, API consistency and support for missing
Twitter Bootstrap features.</p>
